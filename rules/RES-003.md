**Rule ID:** RES-003

**Description:** `pod_uid` is present in telemetry collected from applications running on a Kubernetes cluster, or from the control plane of the Kubernetes cluster itself.

**Rationale:** The `pod_uid` resource attribute enables correlation of telemetry through Kubernetes integration and similar facilities that, unlike pod IP, is robust against service meshes (Istio, Linkerd). In Datadog, `pod_uid` is the unique identifier assigned by Kubernetes API server that remains constant throughout the lifecycle of the pod.

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** The `pod_uid` resource attribute MUST be present on resources associated with telemetry describing Kubernetes pods. 

**Impact:** Important

**Examples:**

* This is likely the actual issue the user is having [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/29630).

**Note:** Datadog Agent should strive to collect the `pod_uid` out of the box when deployed in Kubernetes-based applications, which is possible by accessing the Kubernetes metadata.
