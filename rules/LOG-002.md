**Rule ID:** LOG-002

**Description:** Log records have their `status` set.

**Rationale:** When using log collection methods, it is common for adopters not to specify a way to parse the log's severity and transform it into the appropriate status fields. In Datadog, the `status` attribute represents the log severity level (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, critical) based on the Syslog standard. This leaves logs less actionable than they should be. 

**Target:** Log

**Criteria:** No log record with `status` = `UNSET` is observed.

**Impact:** Important
