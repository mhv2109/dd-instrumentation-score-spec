**Rule ID:** RES-002

**Description:** `host` is unique across logical resources within a given `service`.

**Rationale:** The `host` uniquely identifies a resource, however, it's being misused when another resource attribute is present indicating that two workloads are sharing the same `host`.

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** The `host` resource attribute MUST be unique across logical resources, e.g., different Kubernetes pods. 

**Impact:** Important (so that it negates the effects of RES-001)

**Examples:**

* Resource attribute `host` is set to `abc` when the `pod_name` is set to `payment-abc123`. The same ID `abc` is also seen on telemetry coming from `pod_name` set to `payment-def456`
