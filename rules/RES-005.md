**Rule ID:** RES-005

**Description:** `service` is present

**Rationale:** `service` represents the logical name of the service, and it is critical for service identification. This attribute is required by Datadog's unified service tagging and is used to correlate user sessions, link logs to traces (APM), and is often used across Datadog products. It must be the same for all instances of horizontally scaled services.

**Target:** Resource

**Criteria:** Resource attributes MUST contain a `service` key with a non-empty string value. The attribute MUST not be null, undefined, or an empty string.

**Examples:**

- "Resource attribute `service` is missing from the resource attributes."
- "Resource attribute `service` is present but has an empty string value."
- "Resource attribute `service` is present but has a null value."

**Impact:** Critical
